Here is the following Question Answer:

Q2 [JavaScript, TypeScript] Implement a 5-star widget for an eCommerce site for users to record a
product rating. The widget displays a horizontal row of stars that are either outlined or black according to
the product rating, from left to right. E.g. ★★★☆☆ = rating of 3. Multiple 5-star widgets can be present on a
single page. If a user has not rated a product, the widget will have 5 outlined stars (☆☆☆☆☆). Each product
on the page has a UUID. Hovering over the Nth star will light up stars 1 to N with a grey colour (e.g. ★★★★☆).
Clicking a star will record the rating by sending a request to a web server with enough information to record
the product and the rating. After clicking, the widget will then display the rating the user submitted with
black stars (e.g. ★★★★☆). Submitting the rating is handled without refreshing the page.
NOTE: You do not need to implement the backend.
